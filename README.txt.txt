A simple mathematics multiplication table game!

A small hands-on project using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Used CSS gradients, box-shadows (3d effects), transitions!
Used Javascript innerHTML, show/hide elements, timing events (setTimeout).

This is still a work in progress in terms of visuals and overall user experience... but in terms of functionality,
I am very pleased with how it turned out!
